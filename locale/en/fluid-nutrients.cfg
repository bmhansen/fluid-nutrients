[mod-setting-description]
biolab-use-nutrient-solution=Biolabs consume nutrient solution instead of being powered by electricity
captive-biter-spawner-use-nutrient-solution=Biolabs consume nutrient solution instead of eating bioflux
fish-breeding-net-positive-nutrient-solution=Fish breeding nutrient solution cost equals that produced by nutrient solution from fish, resulting in net positive nutrients when used in a biochamber
biochamber-nutrient-solution-flow-through=Biochamber nutrient solution input flows through, similar to how sulfuric acid flows through uranium miners
water-needed-to-make-nutrient-solution=Water is added as an ingredient to all recipes that normally create nutrients

[fluid-name]
nutrient-solution=Nutrient solution

[recipe-name]
nutrients-from-spoilage=Nutrient solution from spoilage
nutrients-from-yumako-mash=Nutrient solution from yomako mash
nutrients-from-bioflux=Nutrient solution from bioflux
nutrients-from-fish=Nutrient solution from fish
nutrients-from-biter-egg=Nutrient solution from biter egg

[technology-description]
captivity-nutrient-solution=A robot capsule shot from a [item=rocket-launcher] injects a dose of [item=bioflux] into the spawner, capturing it. With regular doses of [fluid=nutrient-solution], the spawner will remain captured.
biter-egg-handling-nutrient-solution=Capturing a biter spawner and supplying it regular doses of [fluid=nutrient-solution] allows biter eggs to be harvested, perhaps they could be made use of...
