# fluid-nutrients
Mod for Factorio: Space Age

Make nutrients into a fluid instead of a spoilable solid.
Instead of dealing with spoiling nutrients now you have to weave pipes around biochambers.
Replaces existing recipes that use nutrients and biochambers are now fueled by nutrient solution.

Also comes with extra settings that can be enabled:
- Biochamber nutrient solution connections allow passthrough.
- Equal parts water required to make nutrient solution.
- Biolabs use nutrient solution as fuel.
- Captive biter spawners require nutrient solution as fuel.
- Fish breeding yields net positive nutrient solution.
